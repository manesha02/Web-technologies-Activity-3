        <li>Top with 2 sheets of phyllo pastry.</li>
        <li>Brush lightly with butter then add 2 more sheets of phyllo.</li>
        <li>Repeat the above two steps 2 more times so you have 8 sheets of phyllo pastry in the baking dish.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle 1/3rd crushed walnuts into the baking dish.Top with 2 sheets of phyllo.</li>
        <li>Brush the top of the phyllo with butter then repeat once more so that you have 4 sheets on top of the walnuts.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle another 1/3rd crushed walnuts into the baking dish.</li>
        <li>Top with 2 sheets of phyllo. Brush the top of the phyllo with butter then repeat once more so you have 4 sheets on top of the second layer of walnuts.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the remaining 1/3rd crushed walnuts into the baking dish.</li>
        <li>Add 2 more sheets of phyllo then brush the top with butter.</li>
        <li>Continue to add the phyllo and butter layers until you run out of phyllo pastry.</li>
        <li>Paste the top with any remaining butter.</li>
